# Rabbit in the Hole 🐇🕳️

In [Ben Awad's 'coding interview' with React Core team member Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEt09iK8IXs?t=1265) he posed Dan the following tricky coding interview question:

🕳️ There are 100 holes in a line, and there's a rabbit hiding in one of the holes 🐰

You can only look in one hole at a time, and every time you look in a hole, the rabbit jumps to an adjacent hole. Find the rabbit 🐇

A good solution finds the right algorithm with the best time complexity ⏱️🔍
